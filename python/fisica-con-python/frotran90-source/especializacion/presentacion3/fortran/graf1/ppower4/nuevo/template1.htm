The following LaTeX source file represents the simplest kind of slide presentation;
no overlays, no included graphics.  Substitute your favorite
<a href="../styles/">style</a> for ``<tt>pascal</tt>''.
To create the PDF file
<a href="template1.pdf"><tt>template1.pdf</tt></a>,
(<b>1</b>) be sure to use the <tt>prosper</tt> class, then
(<b>2</b>) execute the command <tt>latex&nbsp;template1.tex</tt>, and

\begin{slide}{ caption 1 }
	This is the stuff on slide 1.
\end{slide}



\begin{slide}{ caption 2 }
	This is the stuff on slide 2.
	Note that $C=2\pi r$.
\end{slide}



\begin{slide}{ caption 3 }
	This is the stuff on slide 3.
	\begin{eqnarray}
		C & = & 2 \pi r \\
		A & = & 4 \pi r^2 \\
		V & = & \frac{4 \pi r^3}3
	\end{eqnarray}
\end{slide}



\begin{slide}{ caption 4 }
	This is the stuff on slide 4.
	You get the idea.

	This second paragraph is very long so that you can see what
	happens when you try to put too much stuff on a single slide.
	Note: different {\bf prosper} styles (e.g., {\tt alcatel},
	{\tt autumn}, {\tt gyom}, {\tt pascal}) use different layouts
	and font sizes, thus will fit differing amounts of material
	into a single slide. Now, to end this paragraph, here is a
	sentence which is very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
	very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very long.
