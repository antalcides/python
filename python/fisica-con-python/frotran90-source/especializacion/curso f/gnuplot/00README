of gnuplot as available from gnuplot's SourceForge CVS tree

There you may find demo/, more docs, more installation details etc. Only 
the basic set of information is available in the ./gnuplot/ subdirectory.

The latest "official" version of gnuplot is available from many sites, 
including the main gnuplot repository www.gnuplot.org, 
ftp://ftp.ucc.ie/pub/gnuplot/ or CTAN.
This older version, however, does not contain the mouse support.


Notes:

  - You can avoid writing mouse coordinates over xlabel by:
	- do not use mouse coordinates and xlabel simultaneously,
	- try 'set bmargin 4'.

  - Notice that this development version switched to new syntax, mainly:
	- 'set noXXX' changed to 'unset XXX',
	- 'set data style XXX' changed to 'set style data XXX'.
