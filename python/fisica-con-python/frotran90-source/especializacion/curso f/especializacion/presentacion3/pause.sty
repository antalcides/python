%% insert small colored chunks to mark spots in the pdf file,
%% where a break should be made during display.
%% This method needs postprocessing by another program.
%% But one can preview the formatted text, where stops are indicated
%% as small colored chunks. These will vanish during postprocessing.
%% As this is specific for pdf, we will ignore \pause tags, if we do
%% not create pdf.
%%
%% Take care: because we have to insert pdf comments starting with
%% the letter '%' the catcode of '%' will be changed temporarily.

%% leave, if not creating pdf
